# JS Coding task

* The task is to create a basic chat messenger system between two browser tabs/windows on the same device.

* The messages which are sent between the two windows should be rendered on the page, and the messages should identify who sent the message by stating "**You:**" or "**Them:**" at the begining.
No further identifiable information is required.

* Open the following URL in two browser windows to see the expected result: https://mtsolakiszen.github.io/p1/index.html


* You should treat this as a regular piece of work you might pick up, and are encouraged to use google, stackoverflow, documentation or any other resource you would like to work towards a solution.

* You are also encouraged to discuss ideas with us as if we are teammates and use us as rubber duckies while working towards a solution.
